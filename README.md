# Bikesharing

## Overview
### Purpose
##### Given data from a bike sharing company in New York City, I was tasked with creating a presentation to show the viability of the business model in another city.
##### I used Tableau public to create a story in which I presented the data in easy-to-understand graphs. I created graphs to show what types of customers would be participating, the hours that participation was highest, and where the bikes were most used. I designed these graphs so that given similar data for population of another city, one should be able to discover the viability of this business model in that area. 



## Bikesharing Results
### User Data

##### Given population data of a city we should be able to predict the viability of this business models success. 
* I found that gender played a significant role in the customer base. The higher the male population is in a city the more viable the business model is. Female and unknown gender tend not to engage in the program as much, this indicates that if there is a way to determine where more males would live or work in a city, then priority should be given to those locals for bike stations. Gender has been broken down into female, male, and unkown with the colors blue, gold, and red respectively.

* There is a clear correlation between business and residence locations in a city and the top starting and ending locations for the bike stations. This graph can be used to determine where to put the stations in a new city by seeing the correlating layout.

* There is a significant uptake in usage around the normal hours of commuting to and from a workspace. These hours should never be used for maintenance and the bikes being returned to the top starting stations should be done based on this graph.

## Bikesharing Summary
##### The results indicate any successful business model involving bike sharing would be marketed towards males. Also, the maintenance and upkeep on the bikes should be done outside of peak rush hours in the early morning and mid evening so that the maximum profit could be made. Once given data for population density and population gender statistics two more graphs could be created; one showing potential station positions based on population density, and one showing the potential bike usage based on gender statistics.
